# PrintMaster Docker Compose Example
#
# This example demonstrates running PrintMaster server and agent with PostgreSQL.
# Customize the following before deploying to production:
#   - DATABASE_URL credentials and connection string
#   - Port mappings and expose settings
#   - Volume mount paths and persistent storage
#   - Resource limits and restart policies
#   - Network configuration and isolation
#
# Usage:
#   1. Copy this file: cp docker-compose.example.yml docker-compose.yml
#   2. Create .env file with your configuration (see below)
#   3. Build and start: docker compose up -d --build
#   4. View logs:       docker compose logs -f server
#   5. Stop services:   docker compose down
#   6. Cleanup volumes: docker compose down -v
#
# Required Environment Variables (.env file):
#   PUID=99
#   PGID=100
#   ROOT_PATH=/path/to/data
#   DB_HOST=printmaster-db
#   DB_PORT=5432

#   SMTP_FROM=
#   ADMIN_PASSWORD=<your-admin-password>
#
# IMPORTANT: Set ADMIN_PASSWORD before first run!
# The admin password can only be set during initial database creation.
# To reset: stop containers, delete server data volume, restart with new password.
