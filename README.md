PrintMaster automatically discovers and monitors network printers and copiers. Built for MSPs, MPS providers, copier dealers, and IT departments managing print fleets.

## Why PrintMaster?

PrintMaster was born from real-world frustration managing multi-vendor print fleets. Existing solutions meant juggling multiple tools—PrintAudit for metering, Epson Remote Services for Epson devices, Kyocera Net Manager for Kyocera, Epson Device Admin for local management—each with their own quirks, agents that randomly disconnect, and per-device licensing fees.

The goal: combine the best of fleet monitoring and vendor-specific tools into one open-source solution that actually tells you when something goes wrong.

### Transparency

This project uses AI-assisted development. Initial development relied significantly on AI tools, and this is disclosed in the spirit of transparency. As the project matures and gains users, development will slow down to focus on stability and correctness over feature velocity.

The maintainer is not a professional developer by trade, but has real-world experience in the copier/MPS industry and has contributed to other open-source projects (including OIDC SSO support for MeshCentral).

Contributions, feedback, and vendor-specific SNMP knowledge are welcome—printer MIBs are complex and vendor quirks are endless.

## Features

- **Automated Discovery** — SNMP-based network scanning finds printers automatically
- **Fleet Monitoring** — Track page counts, toner levels, and device status
- **Multi-Site Support** — Central server aggregates data from distributed agents
- **Remote Access** — WebSocket proxy to access agent UIs and printer admin pages
- **Real-Time Updates** — WebSocket heartbeat with automatic HTTP fallback
- **Cross-Platform** — Windows, Linux, macOS, Docker

## Quick Start

### Server (Docker)

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name printmaster-server \
  -p 9090:9090 \
  -v printmaster-data:/var/lib/printmaster/server \
  -e ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-password \
  ghcr.io/mstrhakr/printmaster-server:latest
```

Access at `http://localhost:9090` — Login: `admin` / your password

### Agent (Windows)

Download the MSI from [Releases](https://github.com/mstrhakr/printmaster/releases), or:

```powershell
# Install as service
.\printmaster-agent.exe --service install
.\printmaster-agent.exe --service start
```

Access at `http://localhost:8080`

### Agent (Linux)

```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu
echo "deb [trusted=yes] https://mstrhakr.github.io/printmaster stable main" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/printmaster.list
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y printmaster-agent
```

**Agent**: Runs at each site, discovers printers via SNMP, stores data locally, optionally reports to server. Can run standalone.

**Server**: Central hub for multi-site management. Aggregates device data, provides fleet dashboard, enables remote access via WebSocket proxy.
