The exact meaning of each enumeration may vary from device to device, but the general interpretation is as follows: ePowerStateAwake: The device is idle (immediately ready to process a job) or processing a job. ePowerStatePowerSave: The device is in a low power state and will not be immediately available to process an incoming job. A 'warm-up time' of several seconds can be expected. ePowerStateSleep: The device is in a sleep state. It uses less power than when in the power save state. It can also be expected to need a substantially longer warm-up time than when in the power save state. ePowerStateOff: The device is powered off. Note that when the device is powered off then SNMP/PML requests obviously cannot be honored. Therefore ePowerStateOff will likely never be returned from a PML get operation. However, ePowerStateOff could potentially be used in a PML set operation to power down the device if it has a software/firmware controllable power switch. For a given product it may not be possible to have the device enter the requested state due to the current state of the device. E.g., it may not be possible to enter the power save state if the device currently is in the sleep state. In this case a set operation will have an execution outcome of <ErrorActionCanNotBePerformedNow>. The same execution outcome can be expected if the device is processing a job and an attempt is made to e.g. bring the device into the power save state or the sleep state. A get operation on the object returns the current power state of the device. While the device is transitioning from one state to another one of the values ePowerStateTransitioningToAwake, ePowerStateTransitioningToPowerSave, ePowerStateTransitioningToSleep or ePowerStateTransitioningToOff will be returned from a PML get operation. An attempt to perform a PML set with any of these four values will yield <ErrorInvalidOrUnsupportedValue>",
