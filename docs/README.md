## What is PrintMaster?

PrintMaster consists of two components:

### Agent
A lightweight service that runs at each site:
- Discovers printers on your network via SNMP
- Collects page counts, toner levels, device info
- Local web UI for management
- Can run standalone or report to server

### Server  
Central hub for managing multiple agents:
- Aggregates data from all agents
- Fleet view dashboard
- Remote agent access via WebSocket proxy
- Multi-tenant support

### Architecture
