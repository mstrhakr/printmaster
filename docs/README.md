# PrintMaster docs

This folder contains documentation for the PrintMaster agent. Read these first:

- `SCAN_PIPELINE.md` — how scanning works (two-stage producer/consumer, endpoints, progress)
- `RANGE_SYNTAX.md` — accepted range formats and parser constraints
- `API_AND_UI.md` — HTTP endpoints and web UI behavior
- `DECISIONS.md` — architecture and rationale

Keep this folder in sync with code when the scanning behavior or HTTP API changes.
