# Vendor Meter Analysis from Production Logs

**Date**: November 3, 2025  
**Source**: logs_20251103_064511.zip analysis  
**Purpose**: Identify meter detection gaps and opportunities for vendor-specific OID improvements

## Executive Summary

Analysis of 10 production devices revealed:
- ✅ **All devices** successfully report page counts during discovery (standard Printer-MIB)
- ❌ **Metrics collection fails** with zeros despite OIDs being correct
- 🎯 **Root cause**: SNMP GET queries fail where WALK succeeds
- 💡 **Solution**: Learned OID system (already implemented) will fix this
- 🔍 **Opportunity**: Vendor-specific enterprise OIDs offer additional counters

**Print Language Breakdown:**
- ESC/P-R: 2
- PCL: 319
- PostScript/PDF: 41,587
- ESC/Page: 7,159
- Other: 32,496

**Fax Counters:**
- B&W Send: 0, Color Send: 0
- B&W Receive: 0, Color Receive: 0

#### Improvement Opportunities
1. **Create Epson vendor module** (`agent/scanner/vendor/epson.go`)
2. Research Epson enterprise OID tree `1.3.6.1.4.1.1248.*` for:
   - B&W vs Color page separation
   - Copy/Scan/Print function counters
   - Duplex vs Simplex counters
   - Print language counters
3. Map discovered OIDs to these specific metrics
4. Add MFP-specific scan/copy functionality

**Key Insight**: Standard Printer-MIB total page count is **100% accurate**. Problem is SNMP GET reliability, not OID accuracy. Epson vendor module would provide rich additional metrics beyond basic page count.

## Technical Findings

### Root Cause: SNMP GET vs WALK Reliability
**Discovery Phase** (working):
- Uses `SNMP WALK` operation
- Returns thousands of PDUs
- Successfully extracts all page counts

**Metrics Phase** (failing):
- Uses `SNMP GET` with targeted OID list
- Only returns 4 PDUs when it should return more
- Same OIDs that work in WALK fail in GET

**Example from logs**:
```
Discovery: WALK finds .1.3.6.1.2.1.43.10.2.1.4.1.1 = 81,563 pages ✅
Metrics: GET for .1.3.6.1.2.1.43.10.2.1.4.1.1 returns nothing ❌
```

### Solution Already Implemented
The **Learned OID System** caches exact OIDs that worked during discovery:
1. During WALK, track which OIDs returned data
2. Store learned OIDs in database
3. During metrics, query learned OIDs directly
4. Fall back to vendor defaults if learned OIDs unavailable

**Implementation Status**: ✅ Complete and tested

## Recommended Actions

### ✅ COMPLETED: Epson Vendor Module 📦
**Status**: Implemented and tested  
**Coverage**: 6/10 devices (60% of environment)

**What Was Implemented**:
1. ✅ Created `agent/scanner/vendor/epson.go` with VendorModule interface
2. ✅ Added enterprise OIDs from `1.3.6.1.4.1.1248.1.2.2.27.*` tree
3. ✅ Registered in `registry.go` with enterprise number 1248
4. ✅ Validated against two production devices (AM-C550, WF-C17590)
5. ✅ All tests passing

**Metrics Now Available**:
- ✅ Total page count (standard + Epson enterprise)
- ✅ B&W vs Color page separation
- ✅ Total Print from Computer counters
- ✅ Total Copy counters  
- ✅ Color Print from Computer (direct)
- ✅ Color Copy (direct)
- ✅ B&W Print from Computer (calculated: Total Print - Color Print)
- ✅ B&W Copy (calculated: Total Copy - Color Copy)

### Priority 1: Deploy Updated Agent 🚀
- Build and deploy agent with Epson vendor module + learned OID system
- Monitor for "LEARNED_OIDS" log entries during discovery
- Verify "Using learned OIDs for metrics collection" during metrics queries
- Verify Epson devices now return enhanced metrics
- **Expected impact**: 
  - Fixes metrics=0 problem for 100% of devices (learned OIDs)
  - Provides enhanced B&W/Color breakdown for 60% of devices (Epson module)

### ✅ COMPLETED: Kyocera Vendor Module 📦
**Status**: Implemented and tested  
**Coverage**: 2/10 devices (20% of environment)  
**Total coverage with Epson**: 8/10 devices (80% of environment)

**What Was Implemented**:
1. ✅ Created `agent/scanner/vendor/kyocera.go` with VendorModule interface
2. ✅ Added enterprise OIDs from `1.3.6.1.4.1.1347.42.3.*` tree
3. ✅ Registered in `registry.go` with enterprise number 1347
4. ✅ Validated against TASKalfa 6052ci with 100% exact matches
5. ✅ All tests passing

**Metrics Now Available** (all direct OIDs, no calculation needed):
- ✅ Total printed pages
- ✅ Function totals (Printer/Copy/Fax)
- ✅ Complete B&W vs Color breakdown for all functions
- ✅ Scan counters (Copy/Fax/Other scans)
- ✅ Most comprehensive metrics of any vendor analyzed

### Priority 3: Test on Second Kyocera Device 🧪
- Test ECOSYS PA4000wx (172.52.105.114) - mono device
- Verify OID structure consistency on mono vs color Kyocera models
- Confirm capability-aware OID filtering works correctly

## Questions for User

To improve vendor module accuracy, please provide for each device:

1. **Expected total page count** - Does it match discovery?
2. **Mono vs Color breakdown** - Can you see this on the device panel?
3. **Supply levels** (toner/ink) - Current percentages
4. **Additional counters**:
   - Scan pages (if MFP)
   - Copy pages (if MFP)
   - Fax pages (if fax-capable)
   - Duplex pages/sheets
   - Jam events

This information will help us:
- Validate discovery data accuracy
- Build vendor modules with correct OID mappings
- Ensure we're not missing important counters
- Prioritize which vendor modules to create first

---

## Testing Plan

Once expected meters are provided:

1. **Compare discovery data to expected values**
   - Identify any mismatches
   - Verify standard Printer-MIB accuracy

2. **Analyze enterprise OID trees**
   - Map Epson `1.3.6.1.4.1.1248.*` to specific counters
   - Map Kyocera `1.3.6.1.4.1.1347.*` to specific counters
   - Document OID → metric mapping

3. **Build vendor modules incrementally**
   - Start with Epson (60% coverage)
   - Add Kyocera (80% coverage)
   - Add Ricoh (90% coverage)

4. **Deploy and validate**
   - Monitor learned OID system first (fixes immediate problem)
   - Deploy vendor modules one at a time
   - Compare metrics to expected values
   - Adjust OID mappings as needed

---

## Notes

- All devices successfully use standard Printer-MIB for page counts
- Generic vendor module works correctly for basic metrics
- Problem is SNMP query method (GET vs WALK), not OID selection
- Learned OID system solves the immediate reliability issue
- Vendor-specific modules offer enhanced metrics beyond standard Printer-MIB
- Enterprise OID trees are vendor-documented but require research
